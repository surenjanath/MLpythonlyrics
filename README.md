# MLpythonlyrics
##Plan
My plan is to create a song using ML with Python.
1. I scraped 2099 songs with 87 lyrics links are missing, regardless I will now code a program to scrape lyrics off Azlyrics using selenium as it blocks majority 
   of my requests gets.
2. Then I will train my model with the 2012 lyrics that I will scrape.
3. This file will contain majority of codes.
4. Will include a youtube downloader for the songs I've scraped :)
